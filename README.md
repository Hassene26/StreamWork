# StreamWork

Real-time salary streaming for remote workers using crypto. Built for HackMoney 2026.

## 🚀 What It Does

StreamWork enables employers to pay remote workers **per minute** using Yellow Network state channels. No gas fees on each payment. No waiting for monthly paychecks.

**The Problem:** Remote workers lose 8-15% of salary to wire fees, FX spreads, and payment delays.

**The Solution:** Stream salary in real-time via state channels, withdraw anytime to bank via Circle's Bridge Kit.
